# trading-dashboard Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-04-05_

## 1. Goal

Build a website dashboard/workspace for the trading system that is split into clear modules:
1. **Welcome** as the top-level entry
2. **Historical Backtest** as the module entry/control center
3. **Trading Performance** as the trading-and-return layer
4. **Market State Analysis** as the state/cluster interpretation layer
5. later parameter-focused sections kept separate from both

## 2. Current repo direction

Current rule:
- `trading-dashboard` is dashboard-only
- trading repos keep their own output/report generation responsibilities
- this repo focuses on UI/server/data-contract/dictionary work only

The current implementation baseline comes from the old `ops-dashboard` code/content.

## 3. Current state

The dashboard is in an active restructuring phase.

Recent major direction changes:
1. the repo was reset from the abandoned `trading-report` idea back to a dashboard-only direction
2. the site no longer treats Trading Performance as the top-level landing page
3. a Welcome page and a Historical Backtest module homepage were introduced
4. instrument choice is being moved into the Historical Backtest control page instead of being forced by Trading Performance page entry
5. Trading Performance and Market State Analysis are being separated more cleanly so state-interpretation content stops leaking into the trading-performance layer

## 4. What is already implemented

### 4.1 Navigation / module structure
- Welcome page exists
- Historical Backtest module homepage exists
- Trading Performance exists under Historical Backtest
- Market State Analysis exists as a separate module area with child pages:
  - State Separation
  - State Transitions
  - State Explanation

### 4.2 Trading Performance work
- Strategy Variants workspace exists as a unified cross-family page
- Composite / Routing supports selector-driven views
- Trading Performance now has a dedicated `Best Trading Choice by Cluster` block fed from formal cluster evaluation payloads
- cluster-family and cluster-variant best-choice data are now expected to come from formal backend evaluation payloads rather than front-end approximations
- MA variant-id mismatch handling was added in the front end so MA variant curves can render despite summary/curve naming differences
- hover popovers were removed; dictionary access is click-to-open only

### 4.3 Historical Backtest control page
- Historical Backtest now acts as the control center before entering Trading Performance
- instrument selection has been converted from dropdown intent toward a single-select table
- instrument rows now target meaningful selection-help data such as start date, end date, granularity, and row count instead of raw implementation-path fields
- strategy selection has been converted from dropdown intent toward a multi-select sortable/searchable table
- strategy selection is intended to help the user narrow scope before loading the heavy trading-performance payloads
- artifact checklist exists and includes download buttons/links
- the final execution card is now the place where Trading Performance is loaded and where progress should appear only after load starts
- strategy selection now constrains which family dashboards get loaded for Trading Performance
- loading logic has begun moving toward incremental reuse for still-selected families while clearing caches for families that were explicitly deselected

### 4.4 Market State Analysis work
- overview/separation/explanation page skeletons exist
- state module can load independently of Trading Performance
- State Explanation has a dedicated controlled sample instrument selector because explanation is allowed to project anonymized states onto a real market sample
- second-module design rule is now clearer: Market State Analysis stays anonymized at the module level, but State Explanation is allowed to use a controlled real-market projection instrument

### 4.5 Dictionary / terminology work
- dashboard dictionary coverage was expanded substantially
- display terms now increasingly map to mother keys instead of one-key-per-item sprawl
- family-level variant code mother keys now exist for MA / Donchian / Bollinger
- parameter region labels now map to a mother `parameter_region_code` explanation

## 5. Current known issues / unfinished work

### 5.1 Historical Backtest UX
- instrument selection table still needs more polished selection-help fields beyond the first pass of start/end date, granularity, and row count
- strategy selection table still needs more aggregated cross-instrument metrics (for example return / win rate rolled up across all instruments)
- loading experience still needs smarter incremental reuse when changing strategy selection
- current incremental reuse is only a first pass; deselected families are cleared from cache and same-instrument selected families can be reused, but there is more room to reduce reload cost
- server process stability/hot-reload reliability has intermittently caused the UI to show stale content unless the local server is restarted

### 5.2 Trading Performance data flow
- load path is still heavier than ideal because large payloads are parsed in-browser
- progress bar is stage-based rather than true byte-level progress
- family equity curves now need to stay scoped to the selected-family set at Load time rather than a single monolithic all-family fetch
- family variant dashboard artifacts are moving to split directory outputs (`summary.json`, `composite.json`, `variants/<variant>.json`) so the workflow stays small-file-first going forward instead of repeatedly growing one family blob
- retained-data policy is also being tightened: keep summary records for all tested variants, but keep full heavy artifacts only for top variants worth deep inspection (currently top 5 per cluster within each family)

### 5.3 Market State Analysis depth
- State Explanation now has a first real path: dedicated payload + K-line main chart + parameter subchart stack
- representative-window selection and explanation quality still need refinement and validation against the running UI
- State Transitions remains mostly placeholder

## 6. Immediate next priorities

1. finish Historical Backtest as the true control center for instrument + strategy selection + artifact visibility + progress
2. continue refining instrument/strategy selection tables so they help the user choose scope rather than merely exposing controls
3. improve incremental loading/reuse for Trading Performance while keeping memory usage bounded and clearing deselected-family caches
4. continue filling Market State Analysis with real content, especially State Explanation
5. keep docs under `docs/` current as the structure evolves

## 7. Detailed decisions that must stay aligned with implementation

### 7.1 Historical Backtest homepage
- this page is now the pre-load control center for Trading Performance
- instrument selection should stay as a single-select table
- strategy selection should stay as a multi-select table
- artifact checklist should remain visible before load so the user can see file readiness and size
- the final load/execute card should carry the current selection summary and progress state
- progress should appear only after load begins

### 7.2 Trading Performance load behavior
- load should be explicitly user-triggered from Historical Backtest instead of auto-triggered by entering Trading Performance
- the load boundary is the Load button, not page navigation
- during one Load, family equity curves should be fetched once for the currently selected families and then reused across page navigation without re-fetching
- instrument changes are a stronger reset boundary than family selection changes
- family-variant dashboard cache may still be trimmed by selected family scope, but page-to-page navigation within the loaded scope must not trigger new equity-curve loads

### 7.3 Module boundary
- Trading Performance should answer trading questions
- Market State Analysis should answer state/cluster interpretation questions
- cluster best family / cluster best variant belong to Trading Performance because they answer how to trade a cluster
- best region / state separation / state explanation belong to Market State Analysis because they answer what a state is
